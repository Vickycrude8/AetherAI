## Freemium Model Overview

The AI Wrapper App uses a freemium model, which offers basic functionality for free while charging for premium features. This model is ideal because:

1. **Low Barrier to Entry**: Free tier allows users to try the app without financial commitment
2. **Demonstrates Value**: Users can experience basic features before upgrading
3. **User Base Growth**: Free tier helps build a large user base that can be monetized indirectly
4. **Clear Upgrade Path**: Presents clear value proposition for premium features

### Free Tier Features
- Limited number of AI messages per day (e.g., 10 messages)
- Basic AI model access (e.g., GPT-3.5 equivalent)
- Watermarked image generations (limited number per month)
- Standard response times
- Basic app functionality

### Premium Benefits
- Increased or unlimited AI interactions
- Access to advanced AI models (e.g., GPT-4 equivalent)
- Higher-quality image generation with no watermarks
- Priority processing
- Exclusive features like voice input or specialized tools

## Subscription Tiers

We recommend implementing a multi-tiered subscription model to cater to different user segments:

### Basic Tier ($4.99/month)
- 500 AI messages per month
- 100 image generations
- Access to standard AI models
- No ads
- No watermarks on images

### Premium Tier ($9.99/month)
- Unlimited AI messages
- 250 image generations per month
- Access to advanced AI models
- Priority response times

- No watermarks on images
- Additional features like voice input

### Annual Subscriptions
Offer annual subscriptions at a discount (e.g., 16-20% off monthly price) to improve retention and cash flow:
- Basic Annual: $49.99/year (saves ~$10)
- Premium Annual: $99.99/year (saves ~$20)

## In-App Purchases

In addition to subscriptions, consider offering these one-time purchases:

### Token Packs

## Setting Up App Store Payments

### Google Play Integration

1. **Setup Google Play Billing Library**:
   ```gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.android.billingclient:billing:5.0.0'
   }
   ```

2. **Initialize the Billing Client**:
   ```java
   private BillingClient billingClient;

   billingClient = BillingClient.newBuilder(context)
           .setListener(purchasesUpdatedListener)
           .enablePendingPurchases()
           .build();
   ```

3. **Query Available Products**:
   ```java
   List<QueryProductDetailsParams.Product> productList = new ArrayList<>();
   
   // Add subscription products
   productList.add(
           QueryProductDetailsParams.Product.newBuilder()
                   .setProductId("monthly_basic")
                   .setProductType(BillingClient.ProductType.SUBS)
                   .build()
   );
   
   // Query products
   QueryProductDetailsParams params = QueryProductDetailsParams.newBuilder()
           .setProductList(productList)
           .build();
   
   billingClient.queryProductDetailsAsync(params, productDetailsResponseListener);
   ```

4. **Launch Purchase Flow**:
   ```java
   BillingFlowParams billingFlowParams = BillingFlowParams.newBuilder()
           .setProductDetailsParamsList(productDetailsParamsList)
           .build();
   
   billingClient.launchBillingFlow(activity, billingFlowParams);
   ```

### Apple In-App Purchases

1. **Configure Products in App Store Connect**:
   - Log in to App Store Connect
   - Navigate to your app > Features > In-App Purchases
   - Add subscription products with appropriate pricing tiers

2. **Initialize StoreKit**:
   ```swift
   import StoreKit
   
   class IAPManager: NSObject {
       private var products: [SKProduct] = []
       
       func fetchProducts() {
           let productIdentifiers = Set([
               "com.yourapp.subscription.monthly",
               "com.yourapp.subscription.yearly"
           ])
           
           let request = SKProductsRequest(productIdentifiers: productIdentifiers)
           request.delegate = self
           request.start()
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Purchase Product**:
   ```swift
   func purchase(product: SKProduct) {
       let payment = SKPayment(product: product)
       SKPaymentQueue.default().add(payment)
   }
   ```

4. **Handle Transactions**:
   ```swift
   func paymentQueue(_ queue: SKPaymentQueue, updatedTransactions transactions: [SKPaymentTransaction]) {
       for transaction in transactions {
           switch transaction.transactionState {
           case .purchased:
               // Handle successful purchase
               SKPaymentQueue.default().finishTransaction(transaction)
           case .failed:
               // Handle failed purchase
               SKPaymentQueue.default().finishTransaction(transaction)
           case .restored:
               // Handle restored purchase
               SKPaymentQueue.default().finishTransaction(transaction)
           default:
               break
           }
       }
   }
   ```
