# AetherAI - Complete Development & Launch Guide

## Phase 1: App Architecture & Technology Stack

### App Concept
We'll build a cross-platform mobile application that serves as a wrapper for AI services. The app will:
- Allow users to interact with AI capabilities through a clean interface
- Connect to AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic)
- Support text, image, and potentially voice interactions
- Offer free and premium functionality

### Technology Stack
For cross-platform development (to minimize duplicate code), we'll use:
- **React Native** - For building both Android and iOS apps from a single codebase
- **Node.js** - For any backend requirements
- **Firebase** - For authentication, analytics, and cloud functions
- **OpenAI API** (or alternative AI APIs) - For AI functionality

## Phase 2: Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools
- Node.js & npm
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development - requires macOS)
- Firebase CLI
- Git for version control

### Initial Project Setup
```bash
# Install React Native CLI
npm install -g react-native-cli

# Create a new React Native project
npx react-native init AetherAI

# Navigate to project directory
cd AetherAI

# Install essential dependencies
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
npm install axios firebase @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth
```

## Phase 3: App Development

### Core Components to Develop
1. Authentication System
   - User registration/login
   - OAuth options (Google, Apple)
   
2. User Interface
   - Home screen
   - Chat/AI interaction interface
   - Settings and user profile
   - Subscription management

3. API Integration
   - Connection to selected AI provider(s)
   - Request/response handling
   - Error management

4. Premium Features
   - Subscription tiers
   - In-app purchases
   - Feature gating

### Next Steps
Detailed code implementation will follow, including:
- App navigation structure
- UI components
- API service classes
- State management

## Phase 4: App Store Preparation

We'll need to prepare:
1. App Store assets (icons, screenshots)
2. Privacy policy
3. Terms of service
4. App descriptions
5. Keywords for discoverability

The next section will detail the API integration process and core UI implementation.
